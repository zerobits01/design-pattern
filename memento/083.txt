All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about the momento design pattern.
So we saw the mementos are used to roll dates arbitrarily.
A memento is quite simply a token or a handle class with typically no functions of its own they just
store is a piece of data and allows us to roll back to this data.
The memento itself is not required to expose this state to which it reverts the system.
And then we can use the momento to implement for example the undo and redo operations.
