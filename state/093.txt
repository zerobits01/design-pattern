All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about these state design pattern so given sufficient
complexity it's actually useful to define formally define the states as well as the possible transitions
from one state to another.
And what we can do is we can define a lot more than that.
So we can certainly define the behaviors of state entry and exit so we can define the behaviors that
occur as you entry enter a particular state or as you exit a particular state.
You can also customize the state machine in terms of actions that are done when a particular event causes
and transition you can define guard conditions for enabling or disabling particular transitions you
can define default actions when no transitions are found for an event so all of these things allow you
to customize the behavior of state machines.
