In this section of the course we're going to talk about these solid design principles so these solid
design principles are a set of design principles related to software design of course which were introduced
by Robert S. Martin also known as Uncle Bob and Robert C. Martin actually has lots of design principles
he has published various books on software design as well as his blog and the solid are just a selection
of five principles from a rather large number.
Another reason why we're discussing them is because these design principles are frequently referred
to in modern design pattern literature and as a result it's very useful to know what they are so that
when I will refer to them as part of this course you know what I'm actually talking about.
