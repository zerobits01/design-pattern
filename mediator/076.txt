The mediator design pattern facilitates communication between different components.
So the motivation for using the mediator is the following.
So if you imagine a system with many components you know that components can go in and out of the system
at any time.
For example you might have a chat room the chat room has participants but they all kind of join the
room.
They leave the room.
They go to a different room or if you think about let's say massively multiplayer online game you have
a bunch of players but some of them might leave the game some of them might suffer a disconnection for
example.
And it really makes no sense for all of these players to have direct references to one another in fact
it would be a nightmare to deal with because keep in mind some of those references can go dead at any
time and you can't even predict when they'll go dead.
So the solution is to have every single component of every single participant in your system or refer
to some central component that facilitates communication and that is exactly what the mediator actually
is so a mediator is a component which facilitates communication between other components without them
necessarily being aware of each other or having any kind of references to one another.
