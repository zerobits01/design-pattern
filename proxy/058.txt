All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about the proxy design pattern.
So we saw that the proxy has the same interface as the underlying object and to create a proxy you simply
replicate the existing interface of an object and then you add the relevant functionality to the redefined
member functions for example so that the behaviors you want are actually available on the proxy that
somebody constructs.
Now there are lots of different types of proxies and we've looked at some of them but essentially their
range is unlimited.
And there are lots of uses for proxies in the real world.
