All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about the command design pattern so essentially
what you do is you encapsulate all the details of some operation in a separate object and then you define
the instructions for applying the command.
And you can do that either in the command itself or you can define it somewhere externally by some sort
of command process or for example you can also optionally define instructions for undoing the command.
And finally you can also create composite commands and these would be typically called macros so you
can define a sequence of commands to be processed one after another.
