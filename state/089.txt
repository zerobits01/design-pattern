Now we're going to talk about these state design pattern so the motivation for using the state is very
simple.
If you think about it nor do you telephone then what you can do with a telephone largely depends on
the state of the phone as well as the State of the line.
So for example if the phone is ringing or if you want to make a call you have to pick up the phone otherwise
nothing will actually happen.
Now the phone must be off the hook to actually talk to somebody or make a call and if you try calling
someone is busy you can put the handset down.
So we have this idea of state and changes in state and these changes can be either explicit so you explicitly
changed the state from one to another or they can be in response to an event which once again takes
us back to the observer pattern.
So these state design pattern is basically a pattern where the object's behavior is determined by its
state kind of like mind behavior is determined by my state for example if I don't get enough sleep then
I'm going to be particularly groggy.
So the same idea applies here.
So an object can also transition from one state to another and something needs to trigger that transition.
So for example for me to stop being groggy I need to get a coffee or something and then I'll be fine
once again.
So a formalized construct which actually manages state and transitions from one state to another is
called a state machine.
It's also sometimes called a finite state machine.
And we're going to see how to build one in the next lesson.
