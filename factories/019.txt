All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about factories.
So first of all we looked at something called factory method which is a method typically a static method
that is capable of creating objects.
Then we talked about the general idea of a factory as just any entity that can take care of object creation.
Typically when we talk about a factory we'll talk about a class but that's not necessarily the case
for example if you have a method and that method takes a lambda that creates objects.
Then you have a factory wrapped as a little anonymous function.
We also talk that a factory is a separate class can either be external so it can reside as a completely
separate entity or you can actually put it as a nested class inside the class which it actually creates.
And finally we looked at hierarchies of factories that can be made to correspond to hierarchies of types
and can be used to easily create related objects.
