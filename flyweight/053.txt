All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about the flyway design pattern.
So the idea is fairly simple we store all the common all the repeating data externally.
Then we specify some sort of index or reference into that external data store and we can also define
this idea of ranges.
So for example if you need to refer not just to a single element but apply something to a set of elements
you can define this idea of a range as the starting and ending positions within some collection.
And then you can apply this construct to an entire range which once again saves a lot of memory.
