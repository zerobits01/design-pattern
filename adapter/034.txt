All right so let's try to summarize what we've learned about the adaptive design pattern so implementing
an adapter is actually easy because well first of all you have to determine the API that you actually
have as well as the API that you need to acquire and then you create a component or indeed a set of
components which aggregates or has a reference to or something to the adoptee so it's something which
takes the adoptee.
It does something on it warps the interface somehow and in some cases yes you will end up with these
intermediate representations as we've seen in the examples that we've built and these intermediate representations
especially temporary data generated solely for the purposes of adaptation it can't pile up and in this
case you might want to use caching and other optimizations to make sure that you don't run out of memory
and that you don't perform any extraneous operations.
