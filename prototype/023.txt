So let's try to summarize the things that we've learned about the prototype design pattern.
So in order to implement the prototype design pattern you basically take a partially constructed object
or indeed you can have a fully initialized object and you store it somewhere and then you deep copy
the prototype Whenever somebody wants to get an instance of it.
You allow the user to customize the resulting instance or if you are using a factory that's where it
will typically be done.
And factories are generally a good idea because a factory provides a convenient API for actually using
the prototypes in your code.
