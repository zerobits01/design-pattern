The adapter design pattern is a reasonably simple pattern which tries to adapt the interface that you
are given to the interface that you actually need.
So it's kind of similar to the travel adapter in terms of the ideology because we have different electrical
devices and they all have their own power requirements and you can think of it as an interface requirements.
For example you have different voltage requirements you have different plug types like Europe UK USA
whatever.
And the problem is that if you travel from one country to another you cannot just go ahead and take
every single gadget that you have and modify the gadget internally modify its electrics to support every
possible interface.
Well some some of this is possible like for example if you get a shaver a can switch from 120 to 220
volts but that is the exception rather than the rule.
Typically what you do is you use a special device which is called an adapter to give you the interface
that you need from the interface that you have and it's the same idea in software so in software an
adapter is a construct which adapts an existing interface acts to conform to the required interface.
Why.
